The app uses local data and stores the logged-in user information in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Smooth navigation without page reloads.
- **React Router v6**: Navigation between views using routes.
- **Context and useReducer**: Global state management.
- **Local Storage**: The app maintains the logged-in user's session.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for React applications.
- **Material UI**: UI component framework for consistent and attractive design.
- **React Router**: Routing library for managing navigation in the application.
